# DotFiles

This are my dotfiles. The focus is on the shell. My programing preferences lean
toward Python.

## Dependencies

* ZSH

* NeoVIM

* xmodmap

* Python 3

* Git

* Nerd Fonts (included with the files: Anonymice, Inconsolata, Knack)

## Installation

Install the dependencies before copying the files. Just run `sh install` and
all the files will installed. Run `:PlugInstall` inside NeoVim to install the
plugins. That' all the needed steps.
